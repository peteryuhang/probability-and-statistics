## Experiment and Event

- An experiment is any process, real or hypothetical, in which the possible outcomes can be identified ahead of time
- An event is a well-defined set of possible outcomes of the experiment

## Set Theory

- This section develops the formal mathematical model for events, namely, the theory of sets

### Sample Space

- The collection of all possible outcomes of an experiment is called the sample space of the experiment
- The sample space of an experiment can be thought of as a **set**, or collection, of different possible outcomes; and each outcome can be thought of as a **point**, or an **element**, in the sample space. Similarly, events can be thought of as **subsets** of the sample space
